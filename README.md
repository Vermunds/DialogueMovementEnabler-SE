A mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition.

With this mod you will be able to move around in dialogue menus. It also unlocks the camera rotation so you'll be able to look around in any direction. Dialogue menus will close automatically if you move too far away from the speaker.

## INI Configuration
The configuration file is located at:

`<Skyrim install folder>/Data/SKSE/Plugins/DialogueMovementEnabler.ini`

The configuration file is fully commented for clarity. Lines starting with # are comments and have no effect in-game.
Delete the .ini file and launch the game once to regenerate the defaults in case you lost them.
Note that some mod managers may place this file in different locations than the one above. In this case, refer to the documentation of your mod manager of choice.
